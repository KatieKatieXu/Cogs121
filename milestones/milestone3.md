## Comparison to m2

Our UI skeletons for m3 are very similar to one of the prototypes in m2. The overall view and class view are the focus for m3 and are directly going to follow the paper prototype in m2. The other prototype we had in m2 will be a streach goal for our project, and would be represented by later development in the class and so we will not have a screen skeleton for it now.

The similarities follow the flow of the screen: 
- Sidebar with links to classes, central information view, and sidebar with notifications.

Difference is that we are pausing progress on the second prototype and focusing on the first.
