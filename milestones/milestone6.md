1. Screenshots of latest UI

We have stuck with what we have from the last couple weeks of development and we have decided where we want the datavis to go in our project. That was the main improvement from the last week.

We have focused on this calendar as an organizational visualization for the data in our project. We would also like to continue with a second progress visualization based on assignments. It is currently being used to display the data that our dashboard is attempting to make more accessible to the user than the standard syllabus one dimentional list of links.
