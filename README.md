## Roadmap
this will be our checklist of specific units of work to be done, and is split into 2 parts (Backend, Frontent) 

### Backend
  - [ ] choose firebase or sqlite (thinking about user auth)
  - [ ] FILL populate it with our 3 choosen classes
    - [ ] lecture times
    - [ ] assignment due dates
    - [ ] di times
    - [ ] office hours
    - [ ] FILL
  - [ ] FILL Heitor's diagram
  - [ ] 

### Frontend
  - [ ] (insert image into this doc)
  - [ ] consider using google's api / custom ui
  - [ ] calendar filters
  - [ ] FILL scrolling functionality of the calendar "box"
  - [ ] FILL event selection functionality
  - [ ] FILL implement a datavisualization idea
  - [ ]

### Upkeep
  - RECURRING: Nightly update and communication
  - Continue to provide input to this list, and feel free to replace any box with more specific subtasks
  - Everywhere that FILL exists in the above list indicates a decision that needs to be made to make the point actionable

### Deployment

`npm install`
> only if new packages have been added. On git pull you'd be able to see if package.json has changed

`npm start`

Go to `localhost:3000`
